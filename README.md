# Real Estate Price Prediction with Deep Learning

## Project Overview
In this hands-on guided project, we predict home sale prices in King County, U.S., between May 2014 and May 2015. The goal is to use a deep learning model to predict home prices based on features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, view, and other relevant attributes.

This project is highly practical and directly applicable to the real estate industry. It provides valuable insights into how deep learning can be used for price prediction in the housing market.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data, visualizing relationships, and identifying potential outliers and trends.
3. **Model Building**: Constructing and training a deep learning model to predict house prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model using relevant metrics.
5. **Prediction**: Making predictions on unseen data and testing the model's accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **King County House Sales Dataset**, which includes home sale prices along with various features such as:

- `id`: Property ID
- `date`: Date of sale
- `price`: Sale price of the property
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `sqft_living`: Square footage of living space
- `sqft_lot`: Square footage of the lot
- `floors`: Number of floors
- `waterfront`: Whether the property is waterfront (1 or 0)
- `view`: Quality of the view (1–4 scale)
- `condition`: Condition of the property (1–5 scale)
- `grade`: Overall grade given by King County (1–13 scale)
- `sqft_above`: Square footage of house apart from the basement
- `sqft_basement`: Square footage of the basement
- `yr_built`: Year the house was built
- `yr_renovated`: Year of renovation
- `zipcode`: Postal code
- `lat`: Latitude of the house location
- `long`: Longitude of the house location
